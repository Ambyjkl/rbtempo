Rhythmbox Tempo control
=======================
This is a Rhythmbox 3.x plugin that allows the playback speed to be increased
or decreased. It is similar in spirit to rbpitch, but works on Rhythmbox 3. It
is not as feature-complete as rbpitch.

This fork adds support for controlling the pitch as well as the tempo of the
music, and also detects the popular Rhythmbox plugin "Alternative Toolbar".

Installation
------------
Simply copy the entire directory tree to the Rhythmbox plugins directory. For
a local user on a UNIX-like system, this is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins.

Usage
-----
In the toolbar there is a fast-forward button (&#9193;), which on clicking opens
a slider next to which +0% is written. Drag the slider to adjust the speed.
There is a button next to the slider which resets the speed to normal (+0%).
You can choose whether to speed up the pitch or the tempo using the checkboxes.
